      <description>Caesars don&amp;rsquo;t fear the pirate.
 For 24 years, the song (Don&amp;rsquo;t Fear) The Reaper by the band, Blue Ã–yster Cult, was nothing more than a rock n&#39; roll smash hit with countless hours of radio play.

      <description>Musicians everywhere want more - and they want it yesterday. But the answer has been here for two decades.
 Musicians are complaining about the raw deals they are getting from streaming. That&amp;rsquo;s no surprise to anybody who has dealt with &amp;ldquo;DSPs&amp;rdquo; such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Deezer. Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s dealt with these services knows what little actual revenue they can expect to receive. However, isn&amp;rsquo;t it curious that all three of these companies also operate in the podcasting realm, where these kinds of complaints are rarely ever heard?</description>

      <description>How to drive your user interface with browser-based audio analysis

Above is a screengrab from my musical homepage, Multipli.city. There, I host all of my music from over the last ten years for free streaming and lossless download.</description>
