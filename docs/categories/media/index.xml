      <description>Caesars don&amp;rsquo;t fear the pirate.
 For 24 years, the song (Don&amp;rsquo;t Fear) The Reaper by the band, Blue Öyster Cult, was nothing more than a rock n&#39; roll smash hit with countless hours of radio play. It put the band on the map and made them rich. The album that featured the song initially, Agents of Fortune, went platinum in the US, meaning it sold at least 1,000,000 copies.</description>

      <description>Musicians everywhere want more - and they want it yesterday. But the answer has been here for two decades.
 Musicians are complaining about the raw deals they are getting from streaming. That&amp;rsquo;s no surprise to anybody who has dealt with &amp;ldquo;DSPs&amp;rdquo; such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Deezer. Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s dealt with these services knows what little actual revenue they can expect to receive. However, isn&amp;rsquo;t it curious that all three of these companies also operate in the podcasting realm, where these kinds of complaints are rarely ever heard?</description>

      <description>How to drive your user interface with browser-based audio analysis
 The browser has gotten surprisingly good at processing real-time audio FFTs, thanks to the Web Audio API. As a result, incredible dynamic musical interfaces are now very achievable on the modern web, and it&amp;rsquo;s a heck of a lot easier than most developer resources would have you believe.
Above is a screengrab from my musical homepage, Multipli.city. There, I host all of my music from over the last ten years for free streaming and lossless download.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself situated among a great fireworks battle in Brooklyn, NY. As we continue to work out the details about the heightened fireworks activity across the United States, I felt it was important that I document and share my experience to contribute what I can to the ongoing conversation. So, I grabbed an old IP camera I had in a corner gathering dust, placed it outside on my fire escape, and fired it up to get a decent shot of the night sky in my neighborhood.</description>

      <description>In this series of essays, I explore the causes behind the Western world’s regression into tribalism, conflict, and intellectual malaise. As a proponent of Marshall McLuhan’s assessment of digital media, I assert that we arrived at our current situation by being irresponsible consumers of media technology.
By ignoring the prophetic analyses of McLuhan, we brought our own civilization to its knees, allowing the arrival of the “global village.” There is nothing but aggression, conflict, and strife to be found in this village, and until media literacy becomes a commonality in our culture, we can expect to remain in this unfortunate state.</description>
